  <h3>Test:</h3>
  <p>It is necessary to create a Telegram bot that will monitor the current rate of cryptocurrencies. The user will have
    the option to add a tracking currency with a price that should trigger the notification.</p>
  <p>- Cryptocurrency tracking. For example, a /track command with BTC and a target price of 55,000 means that the user
    wants to track the price of bitcoin and be notified when the price reaches 55,000 USD.</p>
  <p>— List of monitored cryptocurrencies of the user and their target prices</p>
  <p>— Deleting tracked cryptocurrency</p>
  <p>- Update target price. For example, /update with BTC coin and target price of 60000 means that the user wants to
    update the target price for bitcoin to 60.000 USD</p>
  <p> — Checking the current price of the selected cryptocurrency</p>
  <p> - Disable notifications for a specific cryptocurrency</p>
  <p> — List of available commands</p>

  <p>Conditions:</p>
  <p>1. The service must run in Docker</p>
  <p>2. Use as a platform and programming language: Node.js + Typescript</p>
  <p> 3. Library for developing bots: Telegraf.js (https://telegraf.js.org/)</p>
  <p> 4. Database: PostgreSQL</p>
  <p> 5. ORM for database interaction: MikroORM</p>
  <p> 6. You need to keep a log of all actions and requests</p>
  <p> 7. The rate of cryptocurrencies must be updated in real time using any third-party API (for example, CEX,
    CoinBase, Binance, etc.)</p>
  <p> 8. The source code, the Dockerfile for building the image and the README for using the bot must be placed on a
    public service (for example, github)</p>
